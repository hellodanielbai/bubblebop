# **Flight Plan**

### **Background:**

Flight Plan is a marathon game where the objective is to land as many planes to their respective terminals. There are three colored planes (red, blue, yellow) and three corresponding colored terminals. 
While the planes will randomly spawn from any side of the screen, the terminals remain in fixed locations.

The player can create a flight path for each respective plane by clicking on the plane and dragging, which creates a line. As the game progresses, planes will spawn at faster rates. Once a plane crashes into another plane, the game is over.
