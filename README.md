# **Bubble Bop**

### **Background:**

Bubble Bop is a marathon game where the objective is to land as many balls to their respective terminals. There are three colored balls (red, blue, yellow) and three corresponding colored terminals. 
The balls will spawn from the top left corner at varying directions, but with their respective speeds. Terminals, on the other hand will appear on the right side of the screen as fixed locations.
The player can direct the ball by clicking on the screen, which creates a path. Players can manipulate the balls' trajectories by making it bounce off the path into the terminals. As the game progresses, balls will spawn at faster rates. Once a ball crashes into another ball, the game is over.
